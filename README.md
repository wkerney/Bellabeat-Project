# Bellabeat-Project
This is the Google Data Analyst Professional Certificate Capstone Project. 
In this case study, I performed a task of a junior data
analyst. Working for a fictional company called Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, and
met different characters and team members. In order to answer the key business questions, I followed the steps of the
data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act to assist the company in making data-driven decisions about the products they currently offer, by using data from an already established fitness data tracking company.
Data is open source on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit/data.
